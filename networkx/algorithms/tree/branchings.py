    Returns a branching obtained through a greedy algorithm.

    This algorithm is wrong, and cannot give a proper optimal branching.
    However, we include it for pedagogical reasons, as it can be helpful to
    see what its outputs are.

    The output is a branching, and possibly, a spanning arborescence. However,
    it is not guaranteed to be optimal in either case.

    Parameters
    ----------
    G : DiGraph
        The directed graph to scan.
    attr : str
        The attribute to use as weights. If None, then each edge will be
        treated equally with a weight of 1.
    default : float
        When `attr` is not None, then if an edge does not have that attribute,
        `default` specifies what value it should take.
    kind : str
        The type of optimum to search for: 'min' or 'max' greedy branching.
    seed : integer, random_state, or None (default)

    additions, any specified keys are ignored---this means that you also

    Gabow, Galil, Spence and Tarjan's algorithm for finding optimal branchings 
    and spanning arborescences. 

    A brief description of the algorithm: Start by creating an empty 'growth path'. To
    start, add an arbitrary node into it. This node is now the 'head' of our growth 
    path. Continue by adding the minimum weight parent of the head node to the growth
    path, making it the new head. Continue adding minimum weight parents of the head
    node to the growth path until either all nodes are exhausted or you create a cycle
    with your growth path. 
    If all nodes are exhausted, this is the spanning arborescence, return it. Otherwise
    compress all the nodes that form the cycle into one node, and contine with our
    process of adding to the growth path until we've exhausted all the nodes.
    Then for each compressed node decompress them and choose some edge from the cycle to 
    remove. Once all cycles are removed we should be left with the optimal spanning 
    arborescence.
