    """Union-find data structure.

    Each unionFind instance X maintains a family of disjoint sets of
    hashable objects, supporting the following two methods:

    - X[item] returns a name for the set containing the given item.
      Each set is named by an arbitrarily-chosen one of its members; as
      long as the set remains unchanged it will keep the same name. If
      the item is not yet part of a set in X, a new singleton set is
      created for it.

    - X.union(item1, item2, ...) merges the sets containing each item
      into a single larger set.  If any item is not yet part of a set
      in X, it is added to X as one of the members of the merged set.

    """Compressed Tree datatype for storing disjoint sets. It's similar to the
    UnionFind datatype above with one exception. Each value has an associated
    real number and the value of some node is stored as it's difference from the
    parent.
    So if we have two nodes of value 5 and 8, then we make the 5 node the child
    of the 8 node, we'll store the 5 as -3, (5 - 8 = -3). This way, we can
    recover the value by adding the value we have stored to all of it's parents.
    We store it this way so that we can implement change_value(self, delta, A).
    This way when we add delta to the value of the set A, all it's children get
    delta added to them as well for free. This is a useful property for some
    graph algorithms.
